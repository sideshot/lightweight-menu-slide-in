# lightweight-menu-slide-in
This code creates a slide-in menu that slides in from the left when the "Open Menu" link is clicked. The menu is 350px wide, full height, and has a vertical scroll if needed. The rest of the page will have a grey semi-transparent background when the menu is open. Clicking outside the menu or the "X" button in the top-right corner will slide the menu back out to the left
